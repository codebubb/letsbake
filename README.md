# Let's Bake!
## A bakery / recipe site mockup with cards of different recipes available.

Thoughts:
  * Javascript is pretty messy - maybe creating cake objects with their own methods would be better? Still relies on a global 'cakes' variable to keep track of what is going on.
  * Hard coded JSON could easily be put into an API with Express or similar.
  * I was hoping to have the cards slide in with the background image shifting a little for each change but didn't get round to this.
  * Nav images are a bit untidy and it's a squash on small screens.
  * Original dribbble image had a stencil outline of a barn on the card which would have been nice to include.
